# Real-World Environmental Policy: Intro

We previously covered the concepts of market-based &lt;g&gt;real-world policies&lt;/g&gt;
  
  - Emission tax (Pigou)
  
  - EU Emission Trading (Coase)

`\(\text{ }\)`

&lt;u&gt;This class&lt;/u&gt;: how have real-world &lt;r&gt;global policy making&lt;/r&gt; been implementing this policies?

1. What was the institutional framework adopted for internation cooperation?

2. How &lt;y&gt;economic theory&lt;/y&gt; explain the mild success of global climate mitigation?

---

# Real-World Environmental Policy: Intro

We will focus on &lt;g&gt;economic tools&lt;/g&gt; that explain:

- Lack of worldwide coordination

- Solutions to free-riding at global scale

- Circumventing unilateral policy

--

These insights explain &lt;r&gt;changes in policies&lt;/r&gt; over time

- And illustrate the &lt;y&gt;challenges&lt;/y&gt; we face ahead

---

# Real-World Environmental Policy: Roadmap

1. &lt;g&gt;Timeline&lt;/g&gt; of global climate policy
  
  - Review: from Kyoto to Paris (and today)
  
2. &lt;r&gt;Unilateral policies&lt;/r&gt; in the globalized world

  - Climate Clubs as a solution to free-riding

  - Unilateral policy, carbon leakage, and border adjustment mechanisms
  
3. Climate and &lt;y&gt;Innovation Policies&lt;/y&gt;

  - Dynamic considerations and the Green Paradox

# Real-World Environmental Policies: Concepts

- UNFCCC, 1992: "*United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change*".

- &lt;g&gt;International treaty&lt;/g&gt; among countries with aiming at the
  
&gt; *"[...] stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous human-caused interference with the climate system", art. 2*

- Within its framework and goals, there were

  - Incentives for scientific research
  
  - Call for regular meetings and &lt;r&gt;negotiations&lt;/r&gt;
  
  - Future policy agreements

- Also known as the &lt;y&gt;Earth Summit&lt;/y&gt;

---

# Real-World Environmental Policies: Concepts

- UNFCCC, 1992: "*United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change*".

- Similar to any &lt;g&gt;international treaty&lt;/g&gt; among countries. Other examples:

  - Basel Convention (disposal of international waste)
  
  - Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
  
  - Vienna Convention for the Protection of the &lt;r&gt;Ozone Layer&lt;/r&gt;

- Inspired on the latter, aiming to reduce the degradation of the Ozone Layer

---

# Real-World Environmental Policies: Concepts
  
- Parties meet annualy on &lt;g&gt;Conference of Parties&lt;/g&gt; (COP)

  - Supreme governing body of an international convention
  
  - Composed of the convention's member states (and observers)

- Goal: assess &lt;r&gt;development and progress&lt;/r&gt;

- UNFCCC was not imidiately valid from 1992

  - It was followed by a signing and planning period
  
- &lt;y&gt;Validated&lt;/y&gt; and ratified in future COPs (by all members)

---

# Real-World Environmental Policies: the Kyoto Protocol

The &lt;g&gt;Kyoto Protocol (1997)&lt;/g&gt; was the first major ratification of UNFCCC:

- Imposed binding emission limits on members that ratified it 

- I.e., limit increases based on 1990 levels **by 2008-2012** (e.g., treaty's mandate)

  - Extended to 2020 in the Doha Agreement (COP18)

- No binding rules about which environmental policy to be implemented (carbon tax, etc.)

- Focus on &lt;r&gt;developed economies&lt;/r&gt;

  - Responsability (by then) on global emissions
  
  - Need of industrialization in developing economies

# Real-World Environmental Policies: the Kyoto Protocol

The &lt;g&gt;Kyoto Protocol (1997)&lt;/g&gt; was the first major ratification of UNFCCC:

- About 35 developed countries `\(\downarrow\)` emissions

  - Global emissions `\(\uparrow\)` 30% between 1990 and 2010

--

- Targets were based upon 1990's levels, not sufficiently ambitious

- Focus on developed countries &lt;r&gt;was not sufficient&lt;/r&gt;

  - Among reasons, countries (indirectly, and partially) outsourced emissions
  
  - Developing economies took off (e.g., China)
  
- Over time, several countries &lt;y&gt;withdrew&lt;/y&gt; from the treaty

---

# Real-World Environmental Policies: the Paris Agreement

Another major related event was the &lt;g&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/g&gt; in 2015

- Update/follow-up of the Kyoto protocol

- Goal to &lt;r&gt;provide guidelines&lt;/r&gt; for Kyoto's expiration period (2020)

More (in principle) ambitious targets based on &lt;y&gt;recent science&lt;/y&gt; (i.e., IPCC)

- Keep temperature `\(\uparrow\)` within 2 degrees
  
- Achieve a net-zero economy by mid 21st century
  
---

# Real-World Environmental Policies: the Paris Agreement
  
- &lt;g&gt;Initially ambitious&lt;/g&gt; in terms of pledges (committments) by countries

- Explicit about &lt;r&gt;need for adaptation policies&lt;/r&gt;

  - Acknowledge that mitigation is not enough!
  
- Notable withdrew by the United States (later rejoined)

- COP26 (Glasgow, 2021): ratification/update since expiration of Kyoto's mandate

  - Current framework of international environmental policy

# Real-World Environmental Policies

What have we learned from history? How do we explain it with &lt;r&gt;economics?&lt;/r&gt;

- Lack of &lt;g&gt;worldwide coordination&lt;/g&gt; - free-riding?

- Can unilateral (e.g., EU) environmental policy backfire?

- Can we have other arrangements than treaties?

&lt;u&gt;Concepts and solutions&lt;/u&gt; we will cover:

- Climate clubs to enforce coordination

- Carbon leakage from unilateral policy

- Border adjustment mechanisms to address leakage

---

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: Climate Clubs

The global community clearly failed to coordinate on reducing (the growth of) GHG emissions

- Global temperature = &lt;g&gt;public good&lt;/g&gt; (why?)

--

Nordhaus (2015) *"Climate Clubs: Overcoming Free-riding in International Climate Policy"*

- Incentives to deviate from global cooperation

  - Benefit from others without addressing domestic abatement
  
  - &lt;y&gt;Intertemporal free-riding&lt;/y&gt;: future generations will pay the burden of current emissions
  
- The result is a prisoner dillema

&lt;u&gt;Nordhaus' solution&lt;/u&gt;: climate club to address &lt;r&gt;free-riding&lt;/r&gt;

---

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: Climate Clubs

Why is there &lt;g&gt;room for free-riding?&lt;/g&gt;

- Based on current international rules, countries &lt;r&gt;cannot enforce rules on other countries&lt;/r&gt;

- Nations are sovereing `\(\rightarrow\)` international treaties are essentially voluntary

Nordhaus' idea: enforce countries participation with a "club":

&gt; *"A club is a voluntary group deriving mutual benefits from sharing the costs of an activity that &lt;r&gt;has public-good characteristics&lt;/r&gt;. The gains from a successful club must be sufficiently large that members will adhere to club rules."*

---

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: Climate Clubs

Specifically, a (climate) clubs must have the following characteristics

1. Refer to a &lt;g&gt;public-good-type of resource&lt;/g&gt; that can be shares (e.g., benefits from a militar alliance)

2. It is a cooperative arrangement that is beneficial for members

3. Non-members can be excluded and &lt;r&gt;penalized&lt;/r&gt; at relatively low cost to members

4. &lt;y&gt;Membership is stable&lt;/y&gt; (i.e., there is no incentives to leave/deviate)

  - I.e., benefits enforce membership, penalties prevent exit
  
It becomes a &lt;u&gt;sequential game&lt;/u&gt;: Nordhaus studies conditions for a stable equilibrium (club)

---

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: Climate Clubs

But &lt;g&gt;how to penalize non-members&lt;/g&gt; under the principle of sovereignity? Use trade policy

- Impose barriers (e.g., tariffs) to non-members

- It internalizes the (global) externality: self-interested countries have incentives to join the club

What &lt;r&gt;benefits&lt;/r&gt; to give club members?

- Liberalize trade (i.e., remove barriers and tariffs)

&lt;u&gt;Important:&lt;/u&gt; trade policy (and retaliation) are permitted tools (WTO)

Nordhaus' DICE model: several simulations `\(\rightarrow\)` benefits, conditions, and structure of stable clubs

---

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: Climate Clubs

Nordhaus (2015)'s illustrative result: &lt;g&gt;should the US join&lt;/g&gt; a climate club?

.center[
&lt;img src="figs/fig_nordhaus_club.png" style="width: 82%" /&gt;
]

- Hypothesis: club with all other developed economies setting CO2 taxes

- First row = no penalties = "Kyoto Protocol"

- Second row = penalties as 4% tariffs

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: Climate Clubs

Nordhaus (2015)'s illustrative result: &lt;g&gt;should the US join&lt;/g&gt; a climate club?

.center[
&lt;img src="figs/fig_nordhaus_club2.png" style="width: 82%" /&gt;
]

- &lt;u&gt;Without penalties&lt;/u&gt;, US have no incentives to join: 7.3 reduced damages from free-riding

- &lt;u&gt;With tariffs&lt;/u&gt;, US does have incentives through gains from trade

Many other simulations and results in Nordhaus (2015)

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: CO2 Leakage and CBAM

There is the risk of a spill-over effect called &lt;g&gt;**carbon leakage**&lt;/g&gt;. Its usual notion is

&gt; *"Carbon leakage happens when, because of costs related to climate policies, &lt;r&gt;businesses transfer production&lt;/r&gt; to other, more permissive countries, leading to an increase in total emissions."*

--

Spatial reallocation of production is one of the margins of CO2 leakage. More precisely, there are margins:

1. &lt;g&gt;Competition margin:&lt;/g&gt; energy-intense industries leak away from EU due to high production costs related to environmental regulation

2. &lt;r&gt;Free-riding margin:&lt;/r&gt; other countries relax their environmental targets due to the reductions in EU GHG emissions

3. &lt;y&gt;Energy market margin:&lt;/y&gt; lower energy consumption in the EU reduces oil/coal/gas demand/prices, making it more attractive to the rest of the world

---

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: CO2 Leakage and CBAM

&lt;u&gt;Important:&lt;/u&gt; evidence of leakage in the current days is limited/not clear:

- Confounding factors: structural change and reallocation of economic activity responding to other factors

- Environmental targets are not being &lt;y&gt;ambitious enough&lt;/y&gt; (yet)

Still, (risk of) leakage is within the &lt;g&gt;most sensible aspects&lt;/g&gt; of unilateral policy

--

&lt;u&gt;Proposed solution:&lt;/u&gt; Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAM, **from 2026**), that will

&gt; *"put a &lt;r&gt;fair price&lt;/r&gt; on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon intensive goods that are entering the EU, and to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries. "*

That is: a tariff on foreign, carbon-intense goods. Would the EU be a climate club if so?

---

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: CO2 Leakage and CBAM

How would unilateral EU policy compare with an actual climate club?

Farrokhi and Lashkaripour (2023): *"Can Trade Policy Mitigate Climate Change?"* contrast the (GE) consequences of two proposals:

1. Unilateral policies (CO2 taxes + carbon tariffs)

  - Modest effects on global CO2 emissions

2. Climate club

  - CO2 emissions `\(\downarrow\)` 2/3 of global goal; major gains for club members (free trade)
  
  - Crucial role of the &lt;r&gt;initial club members&lt;/r&gt; (EU, US, and China)
  
  - That is, high initial incentives to join the club


---

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: CO2 Leakage and CBAM

How different that is from Nordhaus (2015)'s climate clubs?

- Account for the &lt;g&gt;intersectoral linkages&lt;/g&gt; of the globalized economy
  - Global chains require inputs produced in other, potentially polutting countries
  
- Develop a sequential game of &lt;r&gt;country interactions&lt;/r&gt; on whether to join climate clubs
  - Studies the (potential) evolution of coallitions/clubs until convergence
  
- Compare climate clubs with unilateral policies

--

Still, climate clubs would deal with channels 1. and 2. of CO2 leakage

- What about the energy market margin?

---

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: CO2 Leakage and CBAM

Energy market-led &lt;g&gt;carbon leakage&lt;/g&gt;: if a climate club `\(\downarrow\)` emissions

- Demand for fossil fuels (and their prices) decrease

- Incentivize `\(\uparrow\)` demand/adoption from non-members (more emissions)

- It also reduces &lt;r&gt;incentives for innovation&lt;/r&gt; (why?)

Bard Harstad (2012) *"Buy Coal! A Case for Supply-Side Environmental Policy"* proposes a curious solution

- Climate clubs should &lt;y&gt;buy fossil fuel deposits&lt;/y&gt; (or the permits to exploit them)

- This is, of course, a &lt;u&gt;hypothetical proposal&lt;/u&gt;

- It, nevertheless, raises issues related to the interaction between environmental policy and innovation incentives

# Unilateral Policies in the Globalized World: The Green Paradox

&gt; *"The &lt;g&gt;green paradox&lt;/g&gt; refers to an outcome where climate policies, rather than reducing carbon emissions, having the &lt;r&gt;opposite effect&lt;/r&gt;, at least for some period of time."*

How can environmental policy lead to more GHG emissions?

--

- The answer is the energy market-led leakage

- GE effects of `\(\downarrow\)` demand + strategic behaviour of &lt;r&gt;fossil fuel owners&lt;/r&gt;

- Fossil fuel are non-renewable resources: their value also account for future scarcity

- Stricter environmental policies `\(\rightarrow\)` less (future) scarcity

- Hence, all fossil reserves are &lt;y&gt;extracted at the present&lt;/y&gt;!
  - Would investments in clean sources of energy generate the same effect?
  - Different approach: can fossil fuel owners manipulate incentives for innovation?

---

# Real-World Environmental Policies: Takeaways

- Since the first IPCC (1990), the evolution of global climate policy has been heavily updated

- Some successes, a few failures: what explains that?

- Global policy `\(\rightarrow\)` public good

- Nordhaus' climate clubs as a solution to global free riding

- EU's Green Deal: the closest institution to a climate club
  - EU ETS and CBAM: important concepts

- Important role of supply-side of energy (fossil fuel owners and the Green Paradox) in the low-CO2 transition
