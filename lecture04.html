# Climate Change and Climate Adaptation: Intro

- So far, we have studied &lt;g&gt;economic causes&lt;/g&gt; of climate change (Facts 1 to 3, Class 01)

  - Economic `\(\rightarrow\)` `\(\text{CO}_{2}\)` emissions `\(\rightarrow\)` higher temperatures

--
    
- We have also learned how economist integrate the climate in their models

  - IAM `\(\rightarrow\)` study `\(\text{CO}_{2}\)`-related policies (i.e, a &lt;y&gt;narrow dimension&lt;/y&gt; of climate damage)

--

- Climate damages span along &lt;r&gt;many dimensions&lt;/r&gt; (heatwaves, coastal flooding, ...)

  - And so do the related adaptation policies, their trade-offs, and frictions

--

`\(\text{ }\)`
    
.center[&lt;u&gt;This class:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;r&gt;**how are we (or should be) adapting to climate damages?**&lt;/r&gt;]

---

# Climate Change and Climate Adaptation: Intro

- Adaptation approach looks from a different perspective: it takes **climate change as given**

- Complementary to mitigating policies whose aim is to reduce `\(\text{CO}_2\)` emissions

  - Actually, sinergies with mitigation is an assessment criterion (more on that later)

--

&lt;br&gt;

- &lt;u&gt;Why is adaptation important?&lt;/u&gt;

  - Intertemporal &lt;g&gt;timespan&lt;/g&gt; of mitigating policies
  
  - Unequal and &lt;r&gt;multidimensional&lt;/r&gt; aspects of climate damages
  
  - &lt;y&gt;Link with UN's SDG&lt;/y&gt; that are not linked to `\(\downarrow \text{CO}_2\)`

# Climate Adaptation?

# Climate Adaptation: Standards and Definitions

&lt;u&gt;Definition&lt;/u&gt; according to IPCC (2022):

&gt; *"&lt;r&gt;Climate adaptation&lt;/r&gt; is the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to &lt;g&gt;moderate harm&lt;/g&gt; or exploit beneficial oportunities"*

--

- Climate harms/impacts are multidimensional, and so are adaptation margins
  
  - A/C or green cities for extreme heat in dense urban areas
  
  - Improved farming techniques (irrigation, machinery, and seeds) in rural economies
  
  - Migration from hazardous to safer areas

--

- Each of these solutions generates benefits, &lt;y&gt;but potentially damages&lt;/y&gt; (e.g., A/C or migration)

  - This is particularly important due to the uneven spatial patterns of climate impacts!

---

# Multidimensionality of climate impacts and adaptation

&lt;img src="figs/multidim_1.png" style="width: 85%" /&gt;&lt;img src="figs/multidim_2.png" style="width: 12%" /&gt;

---

# Adaptation versus *Maladaptation*

&lt;u&gt;Definition&lt;/u&gt; according to IPCC (2022):

&gt; *"&lt;r&gt;Maladaptation&lt;/r&gt; is an adaptation action that &lt;g&gt;increases the risk&lt;/g&gt; of adverse climate-related outcomes, including [...] more inequitable outcomes or dimished welfare."*

--

- Usually, it is a consequence of &lt;y&gt;intertemporal trade-offs&lt;/y&gt;. Think of sea walls (Hsiao, 2023):

  - Short-term protection against flooding
  
  - Lock-ins and higher long-term vulnerability

- Often, it is a &lt;g&gt;relative concept&lt;/g&gt;. Who benefits (and who does not) from adaptive actions?

- This is an important aspect to have in mind when designing (adaptative) policies!

  - Example: moral hazard following post-disaster aid (Fried, 2022)

---

# Economy- versus *Nature-Based* Adaptation

&lt;u&gt;Definition&lt;/u&gt; according to IPCC (2022):

&gt; *"&lt;r&gt;Nature-based actions&lt;/r&gt; sustainably manage ecosystems and address societal challenges effectively, &lt;g&gt;simultaneously achieving&lt;/g&gt; human well-being and biodiversity goals."*

--

.pull-left[
Also known as [&lt;u&gt;Ecosystem-based solutions&lt;/u&gt;](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/six-ways-nature-can-protect-us-climate-change)

- "Urban greening": one tree = 10 AC units

- Mangrove versus seawalls

No simple solutions: ideal policies must be integrated!

# Some facts on Global

# Adaptation (Gaps)

---

# Global Adaptation to Climate Change

&lt;u&gt;UN's Convention on Climate Change&lt;/u&gt; (Paris Agreement, 2015):

&gt; *"All countries must engage in &lt;r&gt;adaptation planning&lt;/r&gt; processes and the &lt;g&gt;implementation&lt;/g&gt; of actions [...]" (art. 7.9)*

&lt;br&gt;

- Since then, UN's Environmental Programme (UNEP) has monitored the global progress

  - Summarised in the &lt;y&gt;Adaptation Gap Reports&lt;/y&gt; (AGR)
  
&lt;br&gt;

- &lt;u&gt;Next:&lt;/u&gt; three (summarised) facts from AGR 2020 (Neufeldt et al., 2020)

---

# Fact 1: adaptation planning has been widely accepted...

.center[&lt;img src="figs/fig_adaptation_GAP_1.png" style="width: 85%" /&gt;]

---

# Fact 2: ... yet, gaps in realism, quality, and implementation

.center[&lt;img src="figs/fig_adaptation_GAP_2_1.png" style="width: 85%" /&gt;&lt;img src="figs/fig_adaptation_GAP_2_2.png" style="width: 85%" /&gt;&lt;img src="figs/fig_adaptation_GAP_2_3.png" style="width: 85%" /&gt;]

---

# Fact 3: limited allocated resources (finance gap) as the main obstacle

- Size of financed projects has increased over time

- However, there is a sizeable &lt;r&gt;finance gap&lt;/r&gt; between developed and developing economies

- This is particularly important for policy design

  - Developing economies are the most exposed to future climate impacts

  - Distinction between weather and climate (changes)!

# Climate Effects and Adaptation in Agriculture

&lt;u&gt;Agriculture has been at the spotlight:&lt;/u&gt; very sensitive to weather and climate changes

  - It also brought many empirical methodological advances

--

**&lt;g&gt;Cross-sectional approach&lt;/g&gt;**

Mendelsohn et al. (1994) proposed a "hedonic approach" for &lt;y&gt;climate effects on agriculture&lt;/y&gt;

$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta C_i + \gamma X_i + \epsilon_i,
$$
- `\(y_i \equiv\)` land prices (why?) in US county `\(i\)`. What is the *source of identifying variation*?

--

- `\(C_i\)` long-term climate characteristics (why?); `\(X_i \equiv\)` controls (see Dell et al., 2014)

--

- `\(\beta\)` + future climate = small climate change effects in the US
  
- Schenkler et al. (2005) shows that &lt;r&gt;adaptation as irrigation&lt;/r&gt; `\(\rightarrow\)` negative bias (why?)
  - Estimates for drylands alone are sizeable and robust!

---

# Climate Effects and Adaptation in Agriculture

Deschenes and Greenstone (2007) proposed a **&lt;g&gt;weather shock (panel) approach&lt;/g&gt;**

`$$y_{it} = \beta C_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \mu_i + \theta_t + \epsilon_{it}$$`
- `\(\mu_i\)` and `\(\theta_t\)` are county and time fixed effects, respectively, and `\(t \equiv\)` year

  - What is the source of *identification variation*?
  
  - Why does `\(\beta\)` capture the effect of weather (and not climate) shocks?

- This framework inspired an immense literature on climate effects (see [&lt;u&gt;Kala et al., 2023&lt;/u&gt;](https://voxdev.org/voxdevlit/climate-adaptation))

--

- It was further extended to account for long-term (and/or general equilibrium) effects

  - Idea: use long-term (say, decadal) changes in `\(C_i\)`
  
  - Why does it help accounting for adaptation?

---

# Climate Effects and Adaptation in Agriculture

This literature has also focused on (lack of) &lt;u&gt;climate adaptation&lt;/u&gt;

- Burke and Emerick (2016): similar short- and long-term estimates = &lt;g&gt;no adaptation&lt;/g&gt;

--

Other papers have study &lt;y&gt;specific margins&lt;/y&gt; of adjustment:

- &lt;u&gt;Land reallocation:&lt;/u&gt; switch to relativelly less affected sectors (e.g., livestock, resilient crops)

  - Hornbeck (2012): no evidence of reallocation as adaptation in the US (but of migration)
  
  - Costinot et al. (2016): general equilibrium effects in the globalized economy

- &lt;u&gt;Irrigation:&lt;/u&gt;

  - Crucial for shock coping in India (Fishman, 2018; Taraz, 2017)
  
  - Related to long-run groundwater depletion in the US (Hornbeck and Keskin, 2014)

---

# Climate Effects and Adaptation in Agriculture

Other papers have study &lt;y&gt;specific margins&lt;/y&gt; of adjustment:

- &lt;u&gt;Better practices, tech. adoption and financial products&lt;/u&gt; (see Kala et al., 2023, Section III)

  - Limited evidence (information frictions and insufficient credit markets)
  
--

- &lt;u&gt;Migration as adaptation&lt;/u&gt; (idea: &lt;g&gt;last resort due to costly adaptation&lt;/g&gt;; Hornbeck, 2012)

  - Deschenes and Moretti (2009): attenuated mortality effects in the US

  - Cai et al. (2016): strong effects on international migration from agricultural countries
  
  - Groeger and Zylberberg (2016): urban migration as risk-coping in Vietnam

  - &lt;r&gt;Liu et al. (2023):&lt;/r&gt; more agric. employment and less urbanization in Indian districts
  
  - &lt;r&gt;Henderson et al. (2017):&lt;/r&gt; urbanization increased in SSA only in manufacturing cities (and not in market cities)
