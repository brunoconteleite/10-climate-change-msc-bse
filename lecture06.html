# Climate Change and Environmental Policy: Intro

- So far, we have studied &lt;g&gt;economic causes&lt;/g&gt; of climate change (Facts 1 to 3, Class 01)

  - Economic `\(\rightarrow\)` `\(\text{CO}_{2}\)` emissions `\(\rightarrow\)` climate change

--
    
- We have also learned how economists integrate the climate in their models

  - Conceptualize how damages can be reduced (mitigated) `\(\rightarrow\)` &lt;y&gt;environmental policies&lt;/y&gt;

  - IAM `\(\rightarrow\)` study the efficiency of `\(\text{CO}_{2}\)` taxes as a mitigation tool

--

`\(\text{ }\)`
    
.center[&lt;u&gt;This class:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;r&gt;**why does the economy need policies**&lt;/r&gt; to correct (environmental) inefficiencies?]

1. What are the sources of inefficiencies in an unregulated economy?

2. Why are `\(\text{CO}_{2}\)` taxes so appealing, and are there other available policies?

# Climate Change and Environmental Policy: Intro

- Conceptual framework behind &lt;u&gt;environmental policies&lt;/u&gt;

  - Unregulated economy `\(\rightarrow\)` market failures
  
  - Different failures lead to different damages - and need &lt;r&gt;different policies&lt;/r&gt;
  
  - Distinction between &lt;g&gt;local versus global&lt;/g&gt; policies

--

- &lt;u&gt;Direct intervention&lt;/u&gt;/policies:

  - Can be distortionary: how would them interact with other dimension of the economy?
  
  - Can generate benefits (e.g., tax revenues, "nudges")
  
- What are the related &lt;y&gt;trade-offs&lt;/y&gt; for `\(\neq\)` policies?

# Market Failures and Environmental Inefficiencies

The &lt;u&gt;First Welfare Theorem&lt;/u&gt;:

&gt; *"An economic equilibrium will be &lt;r&gt;Pareto Optimal&lt;/r&gt;: no further exchange would make one person better off without making another worse off."*

--

This is the idea underneath Adam Smith's &lt;u&gt;Invisible Hand&lt;/u&gt;:

&gt; *"Every individual, by pursuing his &lt;y&gt;own interest&lt;/y&gt;, frequently promotes that of the society &lt;g&gt;more effectually&lt;/g&gt; than when he really intends to promote it."*

--

Yet, the climate is changing

- Why don't individuals promote the (environmental) interest of the global society?

- &lt;u&gt;Answer&lt;/u&gt;: markets fail (e.g., market power, externalities)

# Market Failures and Environmental Inefficiencies

More broadly, a market outcome is socially inefficient if (one of) the &lt;g&gt;3 assumptions&lt;/g&gt; do not hold

1. Perfect competition

2. Full information (VW's dieselgate)

3. **&lt;y&gt;Complete markets&lt;/y&gt;** (source of most environmental problems!)

--

&gt; *"In &lt;r&gt;complete markets&lt;/r&gt;, all relevant costs and benefits are borne by the market participants (e.g. firms and consumers). It requires:"* 

- No externalities

- Private (versus public) goods

- No tragedy of the commons

---

# Incomplete Markets and Inefficiencies: Externalities

&gt; *An externality results when one's action has a &lt;r&gt;direct, unintentional, and uncompensated effect&lt;/r&gt; on other individuals.*

- Externalities = &lt;u&gt;external aspects&lt;/u&gt; in a transaction.

- A key characteristic: &lt;y&gt;uncompensated&lt;/y&gt; (why?)

--

They can be either &lt;u&gt;consumption or production&lt;/u&gt; based, for example:

- Purchasing the IKEA desk: do we account for (eventually) deforested trees?

- Driving a car (vs. a bus): do we pay for the additional `\(\text{CO}_2\)`?

- &lt;g&gt;Other (production-related) examples?&lt;/g&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Bottomline&lt;/u&gt;: unregulated markets overproduce/consume

---

# Incomplete Markets and Inefficiencies: Public Goods

&gt; *Public goods are &lt;r&gt;non-rival and non-excludable goods&lt;/r&gt; that are underprovided (or overexploited) because of free riding.*

- &lt;u&gt;Non-rival&lt;/u&gt;: additional people can consuming the same unit of the good at no extra cost

- &lt;u&gt;Non-excludable&lt;/u&gt;: extra individuals can't be prevented from consuming the good

|  | Excludable | Non-Excludable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rival** | Private goods | Common-pool resources |
| **Non-Rival** | Parks, Netflix | Public goods (nat. defense) |

--

&lt;u&gt;Bottomline&lt;/u&gt; unregulated markets &lt;g&gt;underprovide&lt;/g&gt; public goods

- Key reason: &lt;y&gt;free riding&lt;/y&gt; (examples)?

---

# Incomplete Markets and Inefficiencies: Tragedy of the Commons

&gt; *The &lt;r&gt;tragedy of the commons&lt;/r&gt; occur when agents selfishly overexploit a non-excludable good without realizing future depletion*

It can arise when goods/resources feature

- Non-excludability, like with public goods

- *&lt;g&gt;Diminishing marginal returns&lt;/g&gt;*, so that the resource is slowly depleted if overused

&lt;u&gt;Canonical example&lt;/u&gt;: the commons (sheep pasture); &lt;y&gt;other examples?&lt;/y&gt;

- Often conceptualized as a prisioner's dillema

&lt;u&gt;Bottomline&lt;/u&gt;: unregulated markets overexploit resources

# The Theory Behind Environmental Policy: The Coase Theorem

Ronald Coase (1910-2013): *"The Problem of Social Cost"* argues that, if there are
1. No wealth effects on demand
2. No transaction costs
3. Well-defined and enforceable property rights

&gt; *"The optimal economic allocation will take place under &lt;r&gt;private bargaining&lt;/r&gt; between affected actors"*

In other words, agents must be able to pay/be compensated for the effect of exernalities

- That is, the role of the government is to &lt;g&gt;create these markets&lt;/g&gt;!

--

Reasonable theory in &lt;y&gt;specific contexs&lt;/y&gt; (farmer and rancher)

- Assumptions 2 and 3 can be farfetched in current problems (e.g., industrial pollution)

- Yet, **very influential** theory that inspired many real-world (cap-and-trade) policies

---

# Real-World Environmental Policies

Despite Coase’s concerns, many economists do see a &lt;g&gt;role for government&lt;/r&gt;
- How should it do so?

We will contrast two &lt;r&gt;different approaches&lt;/r&gt;

1. &lt;u&gt;Market-based policies&lt;/u&gt;
  - Emission tax (Pigou) versus Emission Trading (Coase)
  
2. &lt;u&gt;Direct regulation&lt;/u&gt;
  - Command-and-control
  - Standards
  - Subsidies
  - ...

## Side Advantages of Carbon Taxes: the Double Dividend Theory

&gt; *"Environmental taxes can reduce both pollution and the overall economic costs associated with the tax system by using its revenue to &lt;r&gt;displace other more distortionary taxes&lt;/r&gt;."*

This is a second-best argument applied to the real world (Goulder, 1995; Goulder et al., 1997)

- Many other (distortionary) taxes are in place (income, corporate, ...)

- By taxing emissions, a policymaker achieves the desired environmental goal &lt;y&gt;and raise tax revenues&lt;/y&gt;

- This additional revenue can relax the need of government financing

Elusive theoretical results: can data show otherwise?

&lt;u&gt;The Coase Theorem&lt;/u&gt;: agents can bargain among each other to achieve an efficient outcome

- Property rights are well-defined

- Neglegible transactions costs

In the &lt;r&gt;case of emissions&lt;/r&gt;: who has the property rights over "air"?

- Would the Coase Theorem apply?

- What are the boundaries or "air"?

--

&lt;u&gt;Solution:&lt;/u&gt; cap-and-trade

- Example: EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS); it covers `\(\sim 45\)`% of EU's emissions

# Real-World Environmental Policies: cap-and-trade

A cap-and-trade system has two elements:

1. &lt;u&gt;A cap&lt;/u&gt;: total quantity that will be allowed to be emitted

2. &lt;u&gt;A market&lt;/u&gt;: allocation of permits that can be traded

It is a clever &lt;g&gt;implementation of Coase's&lt;/g&gt; ideas:

- If frictionless, the allocation of permits will end up with the producers that the society values the most

--

Moreover, it create &lt;r&gt;innovation incentives&lt;/r&gt;

- Permit prices are determined endogenously

- Firms can cut permit costs by innovating
